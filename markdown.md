# Easy Steps to Manage Identity and Access
User Accounts

Creating Accounts: If somebody new is coming to school or begins a new job, assign him or her a new account, which they can then use to log in and run a computer or any program.
Deleting Accounts: It should also allow the account of someone who transferred schools/jobs to be deleted instantly so that he/she won’t be able to get back to it.
Permission Assignments

Assigning Permissions: Decide what can the different types of users do. For example when a teacher inputs all the grades of the students, then the teacher can view all while a student can only view their_own.
Identity Proofing

Verifying Identity: Once the account is being created ensure that the person is genuine as he or she claims to be. This could include identification such as providing an ID number or password, answering of security questions, and others.
Federation

Sharing Access: Turbocharge people by running related websites and services from a secure context than requiring them to log back in, so long as they got from a trusted place.
Single Sign-On (SSO)

One Login for All: Allow users to login once and use many services availing the convenience of not having to remember many passwords. Or as when a single key opens several doors of a large house.
Using LDAP

Storing User Information: Have central management for all usernames and permissions by using LDAP to manage all the things in one place.
OAuth

Safe Sharing: Improve ability of apps to request permission to access information belonging to a user without having to make the user give his or her password.
SAML

Secure Data Exchange: SAML’s worth should be leveraged where multiple systems need to discuss safely who can access what with one another.
Ensuring Everything is Interconnected

Interoperability: It is important to check that the different systems and the software are integrated so that user does not make blunder between the various systems.
Regular Checks (Attestation)

Reviewing Access: One must review the users of groups and the groups of users periodically in order to confirm that everyone requires the access they had previously.
Access Control Types

Different Rules for Access:
Mandatory Access Control (MAC): There is information that is almost closed and can hardly be available without prior approval.
Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Users are able to add other people to access the file if they wish to do so.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access depends with the role the person in question plays in the Institution, for instance, a student, teacher or administrator.
Rule-Based Access: Develop regulations which for example could include, for example, the practicing within certain hours of the day.
Attribute-Based Access: The client should be granted access by using personal information such as job title.
Time-of-Day Restrictions: Restrict access by time for instance be limiting the time that the students practice and login to the course after school hours.
Least Privilege: Ensure that everyone has permissions just sufficient to complete their duties and not more than that.
Maybe it is Multifactor Authentication Solution (MAS)

Extra Security Steps: Do not accept log in with just a password, for one should be able to ask for something better than a password. This could be:
Biometrics: Such as fingerprints or face recognition.
Tokens: Such supplies as contraptions or applications that provide one time only alphanumeric characters.
Security Keys: USBs that enables people to log in.
Password Best Practices

Strong Passwords: This should be done with passwords that have many characters, letters, number and specials characters or codes.
No Reuse: Observe that people do not use the same password as they used before again.
Expiration: Always change passwords, preferably every three months.
Use Password Managers: Suggest applications for records of passwords so that users can conveniently store and safely protect passwords.
Consider Going Passwordless: Consider new approaches for the sign-in process without the utilization of passwords with the help of biometrics or security keys.
Privileged Access Management

Managing Special Accounts: Help protect admin accounts and other high access level accounts by adding:
Just-in-Time Permissions: Only grant temporary privileges rarely in performing activities to avoid granting some form of permanent privileges.
Password Vaulting: Secure your passwords.
Ephemeral Credentials: Employ password of short validity so that they may not remain usable for long times.
To some it all up
If you follow the above mentioned steps, you will be creating a system that is very safe to give user access on your system. It means the staff is protected from exposure to information they are not allowed to access during work, and all can work comfortably where they are.
