Easy Steps to Manage Identity and Access
User Accounts

Creating Accounts: When someone new starts at school or a job, give them their own account so they can log in and use computers or programs.
Deleting Accounts: If someone leaves or changes schools/jobs, make sure to delete their account quickly so they can't access anything.
Permission Assignments

Assigning Permissions: Decide what different users can do. For example, a teacher might have permission to see all grades, but a student can only see their own.
Identity Proofing

Verifying Identity: When creating an account, check that the person is who they say they are. This could involve showing an ID or answering secret questions.
Federation

Sharing Access: Use systems that allow people to access different websites or services without needing to log in again, as long as they started from a trusted site.
Single Sign-On (SSO)

One Login for All: Let users log in once and use many services without needing to remember different passwords. It’s like having one key for multiple doors.
Using LDAP

Storing User Information: Use a system like LDAP to keep all the usernames and permissions organized in one place, making it easier to manage everything.
OAuth

Safe Sharing: Allow apps to request permission to access user information without asking for passwords, like letting an app see your info without sharing your password.
SAML

Secure Data Exchange: Use SAML to help different systems talk to each other safely about who can access what.
Making Sure Everything Works Together

Interoperability: Ensure different systems and software can work together smoothly, so users don’t face issues switching between them.
Regular Checks (Attestation)

Reviewing Access: Regularly check who has access to what to ensure everyone still needs their permissions.
Access Control Types

Different Rules for Access:
Mandatory Access Control (MAC): Some information is locked up tightly and can only be accessed with special permission.
Discretionary Access Control (DAC): Users can share their access with others if they want to.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access is based on the person’s role, like student, teacher, or admin.
Rule-Based Access: Create rules, like allowing access only during specific hours.
Attribute-Based Access: Use personal details, like job title, to give access.
Time-of-Day Restrictions: Control access based on the time, like not letting students log in after school hours.
Least Privilege: Make sure everyone has just enough access to do their job, nothing more.
Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

Extra Security Steps: Ask for more than just a password when logging in. This could be:
Biometrics: Like fingerprints or face recognition.
Tokens: Special devices or apps that give temporary codes.
Security Keys: USB devices that let users log in.
Password Best Practices

Strong Passwords: Encourage long passwords that mix letters, numbers, and symbols to make them harder to guess.
No Reuse: Don’t let people use the same password over again.
Expiration: Change passwords regularly, like every three months.
Use Password Managers: Recommend tools that keep passwords organized and secure.
Consider Going Passwordless: Think about new ways to log in without passwords using biometrics or security keys.
Privileged Access Management

Managing Special Accounts: Ensure accounts with high access levels, like admin accounts, have extra security steps, such as:
Just-in-Time Permissions: Give temporary access only when necessary.
Password Vaulting: Store important passwords safely.
Ephemeral Credentials: Use temporary passwords that expire after a short time.
To some it all up
By following these steps you can create a safe and efficient system for managing user access. This ensures that everyone can do their work while keeping sensitive information secure.
